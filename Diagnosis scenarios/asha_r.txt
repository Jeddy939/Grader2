Collated Documents: "Asha R." (Year 12, age 18)
1. Private journal extract -3 August
1.05 am: I swear Mum will ditch me like Dad did. She rolled her eyes at dinner when I spilled smoothie on my uniform. I wanted to smash the glass just to watch it shatter.
1.42 am: Texted Lucas six times, no reply. Heart racing. Does silence mean he is bored already? Thought about that razor in the bathroom. Scratched my thigh instead, felt calmer for a minute.
2.10 am: Whole body suddenly buzzing. New plan: graduate, move to Melbourne, start a street-fashion label. I can do this. I just need investors and 10 000 followers. Easy.
2. Parent email to Year-Level Coordinator -9 August
Asha is brilliant but exhausting. One night she is designing clothes till 3 am, next morning she will not get out of bed, says life is pointless. Last week she spent $420 from her savings on fabric, then begged me to cover her phone bill. She alternates between hugging me and screaming I "never listen". History: her father left when she was ten. We have no family history of bipolar but my sister has depression.
3. School office incident log -18 August
Student arrived late with heavy eye make-up smudged. Argued with attendance officer, stating "rules are fake anyway". When reminded about uniform skirt length, burst into tears and said "Everyone hates me". Calmed after ten minutes, apologised, and offered to run errands for staff.

 Insightful writer, especially on themes of betrayal and identity.

Rapport established quickly; student animated and humorous. Describes "intense" friendships that "burn out".
