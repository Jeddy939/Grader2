Collated Documents: "Olivia K." (Year 11, age 16)
1. Private diary extract -16 July
11.02 pm -Tomorrow = English oral. Already feel my throat closing. If I freeze everyone will stream it on Snap.
11.38 pm -Checked YouTube for "people fainting during speeches" (17 videos). Why do they all shake? Heart races watching.
12.07 am -Practised intro twice in mirror but face went blotchy. Mum says that's "just nerves" -what if it's a sign I'll pass out?
Goal: survive five minutes without fleeing.

2. Parent email to Year-Level Coordinator -18 July
Olivia begged to stay home on speech day, said her "stomach was flipping". We compromised: she went in late after panadol, but texted me from the car park crying. She studies hard yet dreads any situation where classmates look at her -birthdays, sport, even ordering at caf√©s. At family barbecues she sits in our bedroom. She still worries about bushfires and interest rates too, so is it broader anxiety?
Family: paternal aunt has "high anxiety"; no other mental-health diagnoses.

"Asks to email questions rather than speak in tutorial."
Drama (elective)
Withdrawn from unit in Week 3 after onstage warm-up triggered nausea.

Attendance: Four single-period absences on days with assessed orals; otherwise punctual.

4. School counsellor intake -2 August
Polite, softly spoken. Sits near door, fiddles with sleeve. Reports episodes of "panic" when required to read aloud or eat in canteen. Physical signs: rapid pulse, sweating, shaky hands. Worry peaks hours/days beforehand; relief once situation passes. Denies panic attacks in non-social contexts. General worry about future jobs and climate "but no physical symptoms then". Enjoys coding at home, gaming online where "nobody sees my face". Mood generally "okay"; denies self-harm or substance use.
