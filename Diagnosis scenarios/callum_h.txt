Collated Documents: "Callum H." (Year 12, age 17)
1. Personal journal entry  -  14 April
12.21 am  -  Scored two hundred bucks flipping "limited" sneakers at lunch. Teachers are clueless. Easy win.
12.40 am  -  Courtside seats someday, front row, everyone wanting my autograph. They will beg for tips.
1.03 am  -  Dad harped about "ethics". Joke. If you are smart enough to bend rules, you deserve the prize.
1.28 am  -  Need new thrill. Maybe drone dash through the mall roof gap? Would go viral. Risk equals followers, equals sponsors.
2. Parent email to Year-Level Coordinator  -  19 April
Callum was suspended last term for hacking the canteen payment system. We covered the damages, but he shrugged it off. Last night a neighbour accused him of stealing power tools; he laughed and said, "Prove it." He comes home with cash yet refuses to explain where it comes from. Younger brother avoids him after Callum pinned him for "wasting my phone charger". Family history: father had two juvenile theft charges, later clean. No diagnosed mental illness in close relatives.

4. School counsellor note  -  26 April
Charming, maintains eye contact, cracks jokes. Denies guilt: "Systems are there to beat." Scores high on sensation-seeking inventory. Admits three late-night street races on motorbike ("only fun if cops might show"). Says friends "respect a winner" and "weaklings deserve to lose". No genuine distress. Smirks when asked about empathy.
