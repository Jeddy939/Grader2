Collated Documents: "Ethan S." (Year 11, age 17)
1. Private diary extract -6 March
1.18 am -Been staring at blank Word screen two hours. Every sentence looks stupid. Might as well hand in nothing.
1.54 am -Mum keeps knocking, says lights need to be off. Can't sleep anyway - mind loops on what happens if I fail Chem, if Dad's job goes, if dog gets sick.
2.27 am -Thought about messaging Logan but what's the point? He'll just say "cheer up". Imagined crash-tackling the clock so it quits ticking.
Goal: make it to school without vomiting from nerves.

2. Parent email to Year-Level Co-ordinator -10 March
Ethan is missing the bus three mornings a week -says he "feels heavy". He leaves half his dinner, claims no appetite, yet snacks on dry crackers at 2 am. Weight down four kilos since January. He's stopped footy training despite physio clearing his ankle sprain. Spends weekends in bed scrolling job-loss articles. Our family has an anxiety streak (my father had "nerves"), but Ethan's never been this flat.

                           Teacher comment (excerpt)
Chemistry
"Previously inquisitive; now silent, head on desk, missed practical write-up."
English
"Draft handed in late, apologised profusely, crossed out whole paragraphs in red saying `not good enough'."
Maths Methods
"Marks dropped from 88 % to 62 %. Requests extra practice tests but does not complete them."
Health & PE
"Cleared for sport but refuses sprints, says legs feel like concrete."
Attendance: 3 full days and 5 single periods absent since mid-February ("migraine", "upset stomach").

4. School counsellor intake -22 March
Arrived ten minutes early, hunched posture, tearful when describing "letting everyone down". Reports low mood "pretty much every day", morning dread, concentration fog, and feeling "hollow". Worries about family finances and climate disasters but says these thoughts "just confirm how pointless things are". No manic history. Passive thought: "If I didn't wake up, that'd solve it", no plan or intent. Still enjoys coding playlist mixes when energy allows.

Logan: Bro big LAN party Friday, keen?
