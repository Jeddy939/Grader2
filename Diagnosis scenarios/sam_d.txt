Collated Documents: "Sam D." (Year 12, age 17)
1. Personal diary extract : 28 August
2 am: Wide awake again. Street-light outside keeps pulsing : feels like Morse code? Tried to sketch the pattern but graphite snapped twice. Maybe message isn't for me.
2.35 am: Thought I heard someone call my name from the hallway. Checked - empty. Could have been wind or Cooper sleep-talking.
3.12 am: Brain buzzing with the drone design idea. If I stay up now I can solder the prototype before school. Mum will flip if she sees the iron on the bench.

2. Parent email to Year-Level Co-ordinator : 4 September
Sam's sleeping pattern is upside-down: catnaps after school then tinkers in the garage till early morning. Says he is "working on the next big invention". Marks slipping from A's to C's. Won't shower some days, smells like solder flux. Claims neighbours "keep filming him through their dash cam". I thought this was teenage creativity, but the teacher says he mumbled to himself during English oral. Family history: my brother had "nervous breakdowns" at uni, eventually diagnosed bipolar. Sam tried weed once at a party in July : claims it "made thoughts louder" so he stopped.

3. Physics teacher observation : Term 3 report
 Lab work alternates between brilliant bursts (built an amplifier from scrap) and complete withdrawal (stares at oscilloscope for 20 minutes).
 Spoke rapidly and off-topic about "electromagnetic surveillance" then laughed to himself.
 Safety concern: left Bunsen burner lit, said the hissing sound was "comforting".
      
4. School counsellor intake note : 14 September
Presents wearing hoodie despite 28 Â°C. Minimal eye contact; speech quiet but occasionally speeds up when describing "signals" hidden in LED flicker rates. States "people online talk in codes : you just have to notice". Denies suicidal intent but admits "sometimes wonder if I'm still the original Sam". Reports rare "energy spikes" where ideas flow so fast "hands can't keep up". Appetite patchy; weight stable. No alcohol or ongoing cannabis use.

5. GP timeline (key points)
 June : Review for persistent tension headaches. Vital signs normal. Sleep 4-5 h/night.
 August : Mother concerned about hygiene, isolation, talking to himself. GP administers K-10 (score = 36) and SANS (elevated negative-symptom domain). Referred to early psychosis service; appointment booked for October.
 Lab tests: CBC, TFTs, urine drug screen : all within normal limits.
      
6. Text message exchange with close friend "Cooper" : 19 September
Cooper: Bro you missed footy prac again. Coach is spewin.
Sam: Field's bugged mate. Linesmen carry comms packs. Not safe.
Cooper: It's just walkie-talkies. Everyone uses them.
Sam: Exactly.

7. Chemistry practical rubric : teacher annotation
"Failed to record titration volumes : said numbers keep rearranging themselves on the page. Asked to restart three times, then abandoned."

8. Local police incident log : 1 October
Patrol called at 01 37 h by neighbour complaining about `metallic whirring'. Officers found Sam operating homemade quad-copter with camera removed. He alleged he was "jamming illicit frequencies". No charges; advised to cease late-night testing.
