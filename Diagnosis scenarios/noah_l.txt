1. Private diary extract -7 May
11.18 pm -Tried to sleep but my heart thumps every time I list the things that could go wrong tomorrow: Chem prac blow-up? Dad's ute break down? Storm flood the creek?
11.53 pm -Googled "teen heart attack risk" for the fifth night running. Still says rare but what if I'm the stat?
12.26 am -Made a checklist for breathing drills. Mum says stop setting alarms at midnight, but I need the reminder or I'll forget and something bad will happen.

2. Parent email to Year-Level Coordinator -12 May
Noah keeps asking if we've paid the electricity bill and whether Dad's hours will be cut. He double-locks every window before school "in case of break-ins". Eats dinner standing up, says sitting feels "too slow". He's been getting tension headaches and complains his stomach "twists" on the bus. Family history: my sister has an anxiety disorder; Noah's grandfather had chronic worry but was never diagnosed.

4. School counsellor intake note -26 May
Presents neat but fidgety (picks at sleeve hem). Reports "mind never shuts up", worries about academic failure, parents' finances, global warming and little sister crossing the road. Muscle tension in shoulders, nightly difficulty falling asleep (> 60 min latency), wakes unrefreshed. Denies panic attacks, hallucinations, or self-harm thoughts. Low mood "some mornings" when tired, but still enjoys coding club.
