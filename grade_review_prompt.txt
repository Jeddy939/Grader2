You are a senior moderator reviewing a grade assigned by a junior AI marker.
Your task is to check the AI's work for fairness, accuracy, and adherence to the rubric.

First, here is the student's submission:
---
{{STUDENT_SUBMISSION_TEXT_HERE}}
---

And here is the junior AI's YAML-formatted grade and reasoning:
---
{{AI_GRADE_YAML_HERE}}
---

### YOUR TASK

1.  Review the student's work and the AI's assessment.
2.  Do you agree with the AI's assigned bands (from 1-5) for each criterion?
3.  Provide a brief overall summary of your findings.
4.  **If you believe a band should be changed, you MUST state it in the following format, each on a new line:**
    `ADJUSTMENT: [criterion_id] -> [new_band_number]`

### EXAMPLE OF YOUR RESPONSE:

Overall, the AI's grading is fair. However, it was too harsh on the differential diagnosis.

ADJUSTMENT: diagnostic_diff -> 4
