### EXAMPLE_HIGH
Section 1 – Knowledge of Disorders and Symptoms
1.1 What is a psychological disorder?
A psychological disorder is a clinically significant pattern of cognition, emotion regulation or behaviour that reflects dysfunction in psychological, biological or developmental processes and produces distress or impairment (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013).
1.2 Symptom categorisation
Everyday / low-impact experiences (no major impairment)	Disorder-linked symptoms (cause impairment)
Sneaker reselling as a side hobby	Repeated deceit for profit (hacking canteen, sneaker scam)
Ambition to sit courtside at basketball	Persistent grandiose self-image (“own the class”, “front row autograph”)
Enjoyment of coding	Trespass and property damage during “urban exploration”
Competitive rugby play	Physical aggression (elbowing winger post-whistle)
Occasional late-night planning	Consistent lack of remorse (“teachers are clueless”, “prove it”)
Why?
The left column activities are legal or socially typical and do not substantially limit Callum’s functioning. The right column behaviours breach others’ rights or school rules, trigger suspensions, legal cautions and peer alienation, demonstrating functional impairment (APA, 2013).
1.3 Biological, Psychological & Social (B-P-S) factors
Biological – Callum’s impulsivity and sensation-seeking may be partly heritable (father’s juvenile theft, possible low serotonergic regulation). Mild head injury (concussion) can further lower inhibition thresholds.
Psychological – Core entitlement schema (“system is there to beat”), externalisation of blame, and thrill-seeking reinforce antisocial acts. Absence of guilt blocks corrective learning.
Social – Permissive parenting (“we covered the damages”), peer reinforcement for risk videos, and online clout culture normalise rule-breaking. These social contingencies interact with impulsive temperament to stabilise the antisocial pattern.
________________________________________
Section 2 – Applying Diagnostic Criteria
2.1 Core symptoms used for diagnosis
•	Deceitfulness for personal gain (canteen hack, tool theft, sneaker scalping).
•	Impulsivity and failure to plan ahead (late-night street races, helmet-free crash).
•	Irritability and aggressiveness (punch-up, rugby elbow).
•	Reckless disregard for safety of self/others (angle-grinder guard removal, motorbike races).
•	Consistent lack of remorse (laughs when confronted, “prove it”).
•	Conduct problems before age 15 (school hacking, theft).
2.2 Duration
Conduct-like behaviours are documented across two academic years (suspension “last term”, current warehouse trespass). This exceeds the 12-month minimum for Antisocial Personality Disorder and satisfies “pervasive pattern” (APA, 2013).
2.3 Most likely disorder – Antisocial Personality Disorder (provisional)
Callum meets ≥ 3 DSM-5 criteria for ASPD, with evidence across school, home and community. Age criterion (≥ 18) is met in six months; DSM allows provisional diagnosis when conduct disorder traits persist into late adolescence.
2.4 Second most likely disorder – Narcissistic Personality Disorder
Grandiosity, need for admiration and exploitation suggest NPD, but antisocial violations dominate the presentation and drive impairment (legal trouble > ego injury). NPD therefore ranks second.
________________________________________
Section 3 – Treatment Plan
3.1 Approach – Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with Offence-Focused Modules (CBT-A) augmented by Multisystemic Therapy (MST).
3.2 Administration
•	CBT-A: Weekly 60-min individual sessions for 20 weeks targeting cognitive distortions (“winners deserve the prize”), anger cues and problem-solving. Includes victim-empathy role-plays.
•	MST: Therapist works with family and school for 4–6 months, setting clear contingencies (immediate loss of motorbike keys after infractions) and coaching parents on consistent limits.
•	School adds a behaviour contract plus token reward for pro-social acts; legal liaison monitors compliance. Medication not indicated unless future comorbid ADHD/irritability emerges.
3.3 Symptom reduction rationale
CBT-A restructures entitlement beliefs and builds future-orientation, directly addressing deceitfulness and impulsivity. Anger-management modules decrease aggression in rugby and peer disputes. MST aligns home and school responses, reducing reinforcement of thrill-seeking. Empathy training plus real-life restitution targets his remorse deficit.

### EXAMPLE_LOW
Section 1
Definition
A psychological disorder is when feelings or behaviour get so extreme they bother the person and mess with normal life (APA, 2013).
Normal vs non-normal
•	Normal things: likes coding; selling shoes; wants to be rich; plays rugby; stays up late sometimes.
•	Not normal: keeps hacking, steals tools, bashes kids, races bikes without helmet, brags no remorse.
Reasoning – Selling shoes is legal, but hacking and stealing are crimes and get him suspended, so they affect functioning.
B/P/S
•	Bio – Dad had trouble as a teen, maybe genes for risk-taking.
•	Psy – Thinks rules don’t apply, high sensation seeking.
•	Social – Friends hype him up online, parents cover damages so no consequences.
________________________________________
Section 2
Core symptoms
Lies for profit, aggressive fights, risky stunts, little guilt.
Duration
Stuff happened last term and now, at least 6 months.
Main diagnosis
Antisocial Personality Disorder (provisional) because he breaks rules, hurts people and doesn’t care.
Second choice
Narcissistic Personality because he’s full of himself, but antisocial fits better. Not schizophrenia etc.
________________________________________
Section 3
Treatment
Do Cognitive Behaviour Therapy once a week to learn empathy and better choices. Family should back this up with rewards for good behaviour. Might need meds later if he gets angry all the time.
How it helps – CBT shows him the damage he causes and gives thinking steps before acting, so fewer fights and hacking.

### INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_DRAFT_FEEDBACK
Your goal is to provide constructive feedback to help the student improve their DRAFT. Do NOT assign a final grade or points.

1.  Thoroughly analyze the student's DRAFT submission against each criterion in the `RUBRIC_JSON`.
2.  For each criterion (e.g., "Knowledge & Symptom Analysis", "B-P-S Factors", etc.):
    a.  Briefly acknowledge what the student has done well or attempted for that criterion (1-2 sentences).
    b.  Clearly identify the main areas where the student can improve to better meet the requirements of the higher bands of the rubric for that criterion. Be specific and quote short snippets from the student's text if it helps illustrate a point.
    c.  Provide 2-3 concrete, actionable suggestions or guiding questions for improvement for that criterion. Reference specific requirements from the rubric bands (e.g., "To reach a higher band for B-P-S Factors, ensure you clearly explain how the biological, psychological, AND social factors *interact* with each other...").
    d.  Maintain a supportive and encouraging tone throughout.
3.  Structure your output clearly as human-readable prose. Use headings for each criterion.
4.  Conclude the detailed feedback with 1-2 general encouraging remarks or overall suggestions for the next draft.
5.  **After the general remarks, add a new section titled: "Key Areas for Improvement (Summary)".**
6.  **In this "Key Areas for Improvement (Summary)" section, create a bulleted list. Each bullet point should concisely summarize (in 1-2 sentences) one key actionable improvement you identified in the detailed feedback for a specific criterion. Focus on the most impactful suggestions that will help the student reach higher bands of the rubric. If a criterion is already very strong, you might not need to list an improvement for it in this summary, or you can offer a very minor refinement.**
7.  Do NOT output in YAML format.

### DRAFT_FEEDBACK_OUTPUT_EXAMPLE_STRUCTURE (This is an example of the *structure* and *tone* you should aim for. The content will depend on the student's actual work):

**Draft Feedback for Your Year 10 Psychology Case Study**

This is a good start on your case study, and you've clearly put effort into several areas! Here's some detailed feedback to help you refine your work and push it towards the higher bands of the rubric:

**1. Knowledge & Symptom Analysis**
*   **What's working well:** You've provided a definition of a psychological disorder and begun to categorize experiences.
*   **Areas for development & suggestions:**
    *   To strengthen your analysis, ensure you explicitly link each "disorder-linked symptom" to how it causes *significant impairment* in the individual's life (e.g., socially, at school, legally). For example, when you mention "hacking canteen," explain the consequences that demonstrate impairment.
    *   The rubric's top band asks for "≥5 everyday vs ≥5 pathological experiences categorised and explicitly linked to impairment." Review your lists and see if you can expand them and ensure the justification for each is clear and tied to the concept of functional impairment.
    *   Consider if your definition of a psychological disorder fully captures all key aspects mentioned in the top band: "clinically significant pattern... reflects dysfunction... produces distress or impairment."

**2. Biological, Psychological & Social (B-P-S) Factors**
*   **What's working well:** You've identified some factors that could be relevant from each domain.
*   **Areas for development & suggestions:**
    *   The connection between the factors could be much clearer. The rubric looks for an explanation of how these factors *interact* coherently. For instance, if you mention a "possible low serotonergic regulation" (biological), how might that interact with "peer reinforcement for risk videos" (social) and an "entitlement schema" (psychological) to produce the observed behaviors?
    *   Ensure you have at least one clear factor from *each* of the three domains (biological, psychological, and social) and that their interplay is well-explained.
    *   To aim for a higher band, focus on explaining the *inter-linkages* and their combined effect rather than just listing factors in isolation.

**(Continue this pattern for all other criteria: Diagnostic Reasoning (Primary), Differential Diagnosis, Treatment & Justification, Communication & Referencing)**

**Overall Suggestions for Your Next Draft:**
*   Remember to keep an eye on the word count; the target is 800-1200 words. A quick check of your current draft might be helpful as you revise.
*   This is a solid foundation. Focusing on deepening the analysis and explicitly connecting your points to the rubric requirements, particularly regarding the interaction of BPS factors and the justification for your diagnostic reasoning, will significantly enhance your case study. Keep up the great work!

**Key Areas for Improvement (Summary):**
*   **Knowledge & Symptom Analysis:** Ensure each "disorder-linked symptom" is explicitly justified by how it demonstrates functional impairment. Aim to meet the requirement of ≥5 normal and ≥5 disorder-related experiences.
*   **B-P-S Factors:** Focus on clearly explaining how the biological, psychological, AND social factors *interact* and influence each other, rather than just listing them separately.
*   **Diagnostic Reasoning (Primary):** Double-check that all necessary DSM-5 criteria for your primary diagnosis are explicitly mapped to evidence from the case study, and clearly state the duration of symptoms.
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** Strengthen your comparison by explicitly stating why the primary diagnosis is a better fit than the secondary, using evidence.
*   **Treatment & Justification:** Link your chosen treatments more directly to specific symptoms identified earlier, and briefly explain why these are evidence-based for the diagnosed disorder.
*   **Communication & Referencing:** Conduct a careful proofread for any language errors and ensure your APA/Harvard referencing (both in-text and list) is flawless and complete.
