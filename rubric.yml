criteria:
  symptom_analysis:
    name: "Knowledge & Symptom Analysis"
    max_points: 5
    descriptors:
      "5": "Excellent: Provides a strong, accurate definition of a 'psychological disorder' that clearly references distress and/or impairment. Correctly classifies multiple, well-justified examples (approx. 4+) of both normal and disorder-related experiences."
      "4": "Good: Provides a solid definition of a psychological disorder, even if it's less formal. Correctly classifies a good number of symptoms (approx. 3-4) with reasonable justification, though some may be weaker."
      "3": "Adequate: Provides a basic but relevant definition. Attempts to classify symptoms and correctly identifies a few examples (approx. 2-3) for each category, but with some errors or omissions."
      "2": "Limited: The definition is vague or incorrect. Symptom classification is minimal or mostly inaccurate."
      "1": "Not Present: This section is missing or contains no relevant information."
  bps_factors:
    name: "Bio-Psycho-Social Factors"
    max_points: 5
    descriptors:
      "5": "Excellent: Clearly identifies relevant factors in all three domains (Biological, Psychological, Social) and insightfully explains how they likely interact and contribute to the disorder."
      "4": "Good: Identifies factors in all three domains and provides a clear explanation of their contribution, even if the interaction between them isn't fully detailed."
      "3": "Adequate: Identifies relevant factors from at least two of the three domains but provides only a minimal explanation of their role."
      "2": "Limited: Identifies factors from only one domain, or the identified factors are largely incorrect or irrelevant."
      "1": "Not Present: This section is missing."
  diagnostic_primary:
    name: "Diagnostic Reasoning (Primary)"
    max_points: 5
    descriptors:
      "5": "Excellent: Proposes a correct primary diagnosis with strong justification. The argument effectively links multiple specific pieces of evidence from the case to key features of the disorder."
      "4": "Good: Proposes a correct diagnosis with solid, evidence-based justification, even if it doesn't explicitly reference formal diagnostic criteria for every point."
      "3": "Adequate: Proposes a plausible diagnosis, but the justification is general, restating symptoms without clearly linking them to the diagnosis."
      "2": "Limited: Proposes an incorrect or very poorly supported diagnosis."
      "1": "Not Present: No primary diagnosis is provided."
  diagnostic_diff:
    name: "Differential Diagnosis"
    max_points: 5
    descriptors:
      "5": "Excellent: Identifies a plausible alternative disorder and provides a compelling, evidence-based argument for why the primary diagnosis is a better fit."
      "4": "Good: Identifies a plausible alternative and offers a clear comparison to the primary diagnosis, successfully explaining why one is more likely."
      "3": "Adequate: Names a plausible alternative disorder but provides only a minimal or superficial comparison to the primary diagnosis."
      "2": "Limited: Names an inappropriate alternative disorder, or the comparison is unclear or incorrect."
      "1": "Not Present: No differential diagnosis is provided."
  treatment:
    name: "Treatment & Justification"
    max_points: 5
    descriptors:
      "5": "Excellent: Recommends specific, evidence-based treatments and clearly explains how the treatment addresses the core issues or primary symptoms of the diagnosis."
      "4": "Good: Recommends appropriate, evidence-based treatments with a solid, general justification for why they would be effective for the disorder."
      "3": "Adequate: Recommends a suitable type of treatment (e.g., 'therapy,' 'medication') but with little specific detail or justification."
      "2": "Limited: Recommends a vague, inappropriate, or poorly explained treatment."
      "1": "Not Present: No treatment plan is provided."
  communication:
    name: "Communication & Referencing"
    max_points: 5
    descriptors:
      "5": "Excellent: Writing is clear, professional, and well-organized, with minimal to no errors in grammar or spelling. Referencing is present and follows the specified format well."
      "4": "Good: Writing is mostly clear and structured. There may be a few noticeable errors in grammar or referencing, but they do not hinder understanding."
      "3": "Adequate: The structure is understandable but may be disorganized. There are several errors in grammar or referencing that sometimes make it harder to read."
      "2": "Limited: The writing is difficult to follow due to poor structure, frequent errors, or major issues with referencing."
      "1": "Not Present: The submission is incoherent or missing."
