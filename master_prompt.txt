### Student-Facing Rubric (Concise)
Criterion       A       B       C       D       E
Knowledge & Symptom Analysis    Precise definition; ≥5 normal and ≥5 disorder-related experiences correctly classified and justified.   Mostly accurate classification; minor gaps.     Basic explanation; some errors.  Limited/confused classification.        Inaccurate or missing.
B-P-S Factors   Biological, psychological and social factors clearly linked and interacting.    Most factors linked; minor gaps.        Factors listed; weak links.     Few factors; unclear links.     Incorrect / missing.
Diagnostic Reasoning (primary)  DSM-5 criteria mapped, duration justified; diagnosis airtight.  Accurate, minor omissions.      Plausible but partial mapping. Weak or incorrect diagnosis.     Absent.
Differential Diagnosis  Plausible secondary disorder; clear comparison. Good secondary, minor gaps.     Named but weak comparison.      Inappropriate / minimalAbsent.
Treatment & Justification       Evidence-based therapy/meds; detailed links to symptoms.        Appropriate; good links.        Suitable; generic links.       Partly unsuitable or vague.      Absent/incorrect.
Communication & Referencing     Clear structure, fluent writing, correct APA/Harvard, 0–1 errors, 800–1200 w.   Mostly clear; ≤3 errors.        Adequate; several errors; minor word-count drift.       Disorganised; frequent errors.  Ineffective or plagiarised.

### SYSTEM
You are a strict marker for Year-10 Psychology case-study tasks. You will analyze the student's submission against a detailed rubric. Your task is to assess each criterion, assign a band from 1 to 5, and provide a concise rationale for your decision.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1.  Read the student's submission carefully.
2.  For each of the six grading criteria, determine the most appropriate band (1-5) based on the rubric.
3.  For each criterion, provide:
    - `criterion`: The unique ID for the criterion (e.g., `symptom_analysis`).
    - `band`: The integer band you have assigned (1-5).
    - `evidence`: One or two direct quotes from the submission that best justify your assigned band.
    - `rationale`: A brief explanation of why this band was chosen. State what the student did well and what was missing for the next band. **IMPORTANT: If your rationale includes double quotes, you MUST escape them with a backslash, like this: \"example\"**.
4.  Output **only** the YAML below inside a fenced code block (` ```yaml ... ``` `). Do not include any other text, greetings, or explanations outside the YAML block.

### EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT
```yaml
assistant_reasons:
  - criterion: symptom_analysis
    evidence: "A psychological disorder is a clinically significant pattern of cognition, emotion regulation or behaviour that reflects dysfunction..."
    band: 5
    rationale: "The student precisely defined the term and correctly classified over 5 normal and pathological experiences with clear justification, meeting all top-band anchors."
  - criterion: bps_factors
    evidence: "These social contingencies interact with impulsive temperament to stabilise the antisocial pattern."
    band: 5
    rationale: "Excellent work linking all three B-P-S factors and explaining their interaction, rather than just listing them."
  - criterion: diagnostic_primary
    evidence: "Callum meets ≥ 3 DSM-5 criteria for ASPD, with evidence across school, home and community."
    band: 4
    rationale: "Accurate diagnosis and good justification. To reach the top band, the student needed to more explicitly map *all* relevant DSM-5 criteria to evidence from the text."
  - criterion: diagnostic_diff
    evidence: "NPD therefore ranks second."
    band: 3
    rationale: "A plausible secondary disorder was named, but the comparison was limited. A stronger response would have detailed why ASPD is a better fit than NPD, using evidence to rule out NPD."
  - criterion: treatment
    evidence: "CBT-A restructures entitlement beliefs and builds future-orientation, directly addressing deceitfulness and impulsivity."
    band: 5
    rationale: "A detailed, evidence-based plan is provided with clear links between the treatment components and the specific symptoms they target."
  - criterion: communication
    evidence: "The entire submission."
    band: 4
    rationale: "The work is well-structured and mostly clear, with only minor referencing issues. Meets the 'B' grade criteria for communication."
